Example parametric gear design file.

An example program demonstrating the use of OpenSCAD to create 
parametrically-defined spur gears for 3D protoyping. 
This program was originally developed Leemon Baird 
(Leemon@Leemon.com) and contributed to thingiverse in 2011
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505 under the title of
Public Domain Parametric Involute Spur Gear (and involute 
helical gear and involute rack) version 1.1. 

The prgroam has been modified for Sage Ridge Robotics

I have moved the original and Creative Commons license text to 
the end of the file for readability and heavily edited 
Leemon Baird's text adding some comments along the way. 
I have added an inner cylinder on the gears to facilitate 
mounting to 1/8 inch rods (this can be changed as needed in the 
parameters, as always in millimeters) and screw mount holes 
consistent with our Actobotics robotics build kit. 

This file will export a single object in stl, so do not
use it to print gears. You must modify it to fit your needs.

Tthe positioning of the screw holes must be modified for 
correct use with servos, 

For use with the FTC build kit, the size and position of drill holes
will need to be modified.
